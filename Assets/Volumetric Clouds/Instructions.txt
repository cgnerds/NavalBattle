CloudsToy  V1.0

Just drag the CloudsToy Mngr prefab to scene or you can drag the ClodsToy script to a GameObject
to start from scracth, in that case you must assign the textures of the clouds manually.

The first variable "Maximun Clouds" create all the clouds that CloudsToy is gonna manage, they could be visible or invisible depending on the
"Clouds Num" variable. So, one started the execution of Unity, DO NOT change this first variable, because it will crash for sure.
Ideally, once you fine tune your clouds to fit your needs, the Maximun Clouds and the Clouds Num variables, should have the same value 
(all the clouds you see, are all the clouds the system is managing).

The Repaint Clouds button is used because not all actions in the editor are gonna change all the clouds in realtime mode,  it could be too slow, depending on 
the number of clouds that CloudsToy is managing (visible or invisible), so if you wanna ensure you how actually the clouds looks like, hit the Repain button.

Soft Clouds is used to make sunrise type of clouds, very large a soft, almost transparent.

Be aware that depending on the numer of clouds, the type of render, the detail of the cloud (number of particles that any cloud has), and the size
width, height and depth, the FPS of the system may goes down  dramatically. All this variables can be changed in the editor in realtime mode if you want.

All the clouds can have their own shadow (configurable by the user), for that to work properly the clouds are stored in the 31th layer, that is
reserved by this application for their pourposes (basically ignore proyector layer number 31), so you can go to the layers window in Unity and 
rename if you want the 31th layer using any name of your choice (CloudsToy maybe?).

That's basically all the important stuff you have to know. Play with the cloud system a little bit and you'll see how fun is it.
(NOTE : With the appropiatte skyBox the clouds will look much better).
